Problem: in such a polarized media landscape
  1. People now more than ever are boxed into 1 or some small subset of media topics
    - topics are treated with such volatility it's hard to get past certain rhetoric and evaluate from a more informaed position

Ideas:
  1. Can we graph treatment of certain topics vs polls conducted by those outlets?


Goals:
  1. For an individual, can we give them the ability to make a better perspective of media outlets for the purpose of making a choice to inform themselves
  2. Tool to compare media sites and the social impact that they have
  3. Plot sentiment scores over time for certain topics by news outlet

Steps:
  1. Pick a comprehensive set of popular media sources and provide "analytics" on those
  2. Current topics to test on: election/individual parties

Tools:
  1. Azure
    a. text analytics/sentiment analysis
  2. Watson
    a. alchemy news api
