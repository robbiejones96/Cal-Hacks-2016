Media Outlet Sentiment Analyzer

We are working on a desktop application that uses Microsoft Azure Bing Search to get articles from news sites based on certain topics,
uses Boiler Pipe to extract the text from these articles, and then performs sentiment analysis using Microsoft Azure Text Analytics API 
(under the Cognitive Services branch). We will the graph the results of this sentiment analysis of articles oevr time to show users
variations in each media outlet's portrayal of a certain topic over time.

The goal of this project is to provide a tool that will inform consumers of media about the biases and leanings of sentiment of the news 
providers that they read.

This project was done at Calhacks 3.0 over the weekend of Nov 11-13
